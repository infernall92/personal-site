          <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Hristo. I'm 31 years old and I have a little daughter. More than 10 years wandering between jobs and trying to find which is my favourite I decided to look more into IT. I like to design too. That's why I chose web development. Currently going through a Web Development Bootcamp in Udemy. Also I have basic knowledge of Photoshop and Premiere Pro. Thats not all, but thats a project that needs to be done so that will be for now ;D</p>
